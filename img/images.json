We collaborated closely with tech department on this, discussing possible ideas and setbacks that may arise, and I improved my Unity engine understanding by a whole lot, as well as strengthened my theoretical knowledge of level design (pathing, waypoints, visual cues, etc.). <ul class='list-disc font-semibold p-2'><li>Designed over 17 puzzles</li> <li>Level Set-Dressing</li><li>Created Custom Shader Nodes and HLSL Shaders</li><li>Modeled and Animated Over 16 Characters</li><li>Camera Setups and Cinemachine</li></ul><a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/2936420/Ghost_Moon_High_Noon/'>Steam</a>"

    "text": "Designing the protagonist and level pathing for this game was my first experience with fast-paced parkour games, and sci-fi games in general. Keeping the look minimalistic and straight to the point was fairly challenging, as well as creating the environment and waypoints for the player. However, I take pride in this project. Me and the team worked hard to put all of the assets together and make the experience enjoyable, fun, and like something that keeps players focused and immersed in the game.\n<ul class='list-disc font-semibold p-2'>\n<li>Scripted AI Behavior</li>\n<li>Coded Projectile Targeting</li>\n<li>Designed a 5-Minute Minimum Level Pathing with Obstacles</li>\n<li>Created Sliding and Magnetizing Mechanics</li>\n</ul>",

Main challenge was to design the tracks to not be entertaining in a single dimension, but make players ride upside down as well.<ul class='list-disc font-semibold p-2'>\n<li>Made Drifting and Accelerating Mechanics</li>\n<li>Created a Pixel Shader in Unity</li>\n<li>Made VFX and Animations out of Sprite Sheets</li>\n<li>Developed Shrinking & Expanding Mechanics</li>\n</ul>",
